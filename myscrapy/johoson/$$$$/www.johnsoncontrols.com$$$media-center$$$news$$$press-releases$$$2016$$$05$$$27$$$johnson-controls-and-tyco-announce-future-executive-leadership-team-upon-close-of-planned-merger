<p>There may be statements in this communication that are, or could be, &quot;forward-looking statements&quot; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, therefore, subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, statements regarding Johnson Controls' or the combined company's future financial position, sales, costs, earnings, cash flows, other measures of results of operations, capital expenditures or debt levels are forward-looking statements. Words such as &quot;may,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;expect,&quot; &quot;intend,&quot; &quot;estimate,&quot; &quot;anticipate,&quot; &quot;believe,&quot; &quot;should,&quot; &quot;forecast,&quot; &quot;project&quot; or &quot;plan&quot; or terms of similar meaning are also generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Johnson Controls cautions that these statements are subject to numerous important risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond Johnson Controls' control, that could cause Johnson Controls or the combined company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, among others, risks related to: Johnson Controls' and/or Tyco's ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and shareholder approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the transaction on a timely basis or at all, any delay or inability of the combined company to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the transaction, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates, policies or interpretations, the loss of key senior management, anticipated tax treatment of the combined company, the value of the Tyco shares to be issued in the transaction, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities, potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction, the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Johnson Controls' business, competitive responses to the proposed transaction and general economic and business conditions that affect the combined company following the transaction.

<p><b>Tyco Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b></p>

<p>This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, but not limited to, Tyco's expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we assume no duty to update forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from current projections.</p>

<p>Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including, in addition to factors previously disclosed in Tyco's reports filed with the SEC, which are available at <a href="http://www.sec.gov" rel="nofollow">www.sec.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.Tyco.com" rel="nofollow">www.Tyco.com</a> under the &quot;Investor Relations&quot; tab, and those identified elsewhere in this communication, risks relating to the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the new combined company's operations, the ability of Tyco and Johnson Controls to integrate their businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies, changes in tax laws or interpretations, access to available financing, potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction, and the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Tyco's business.</p>
